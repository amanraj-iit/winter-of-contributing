Sampling Distribution of the Mean
The definition for the central limit theorem also refers to “the sampling distribution of the mean.”
What’s that?

Typically, you perform a study once, and you might calculate the mean of that one sample. Now, imagine
that you repeat the study many times and collect the same sample size for each one. Then, you calculate
the mean for each of these samples and graph them on a histogram. The histogram displays the distribution
of sample means, which statisticians refer to as the sampling distribution of the mean.

Fortunately, we don’t have to repeat studies many times to estimate the sampling distribution of the mean.
Statistical procedures can estimate that from a single random sample.

The shape of the sampling distribution depends on the sample size. If you perform the study using 
the same procedure and change only the sample size, the shape of the sampling distribution will differ
for each sample size. And, that brings us to the next part of the CLT definition!
